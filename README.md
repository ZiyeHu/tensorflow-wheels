# Tensorflow Wheels
Tensorflow wheels I've been building and using over time.

| TF | HW |Python | CUDA | cuDNN | XLA | OS | Download |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:----:|:-------:|:-----:|:------------:|:------:|
| 1.13.0rc1 |GPU|   3.6  | 10.0 |  7.4  | yes | Linux x86_64 |[**Download**](https://github.com/davidenunes/tensorflow-wheels/issues/1)|

## Need a different build?
I'm using this as a repository of TF wheels I'll be using in various projects, if you want a particular build and don't have the reasources to build from sources yourself, open an issue and I'll see if I can help, or drop me a line at [@davidelnunes](https://twitter.com/davidelnunes)

## Donating
If you find any of these useful, let me know in the respective issue, or consider buying me a coffee, coffee is great!
